==========

Skype remote controller

Will update more later but off the top of my head

-Reciever
=========

-.Code needs to finish getting cleaned up - added most functions into seperate class, some still remain.

-.Webcam integrationd *cough gohan*

-.Needs more error handeling incase of disconnect and to ensure stability

-.HTTPWebRequests should be used instead of webclients

-.A file grab method?

  if (File.Exists(Path))
        {
          //Email the file to user 
          //Or something along those lines
        } 


-Skype chat listener
====================

-.Needs to be cleaned up alot

-.All commands need to be added and to pass proper parameters to server script

-.Needs some basic user tools such as a resolve command that resolves a domain to ip and outputs in chat


-Server Files
=============

-.Should be good to go, may require minor tweaking but I can take care of that


....And more to come, now to sleep.
