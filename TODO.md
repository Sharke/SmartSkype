==========

Skype remote controller

Will update more later but off the top of my head

-Reciever
.Code needs to finish getting cleaned up - added most functions into seperate class, some still remain.
.Webcam integrationd
.Needs more error handeling incase of disconnect and to ensure stability
.HTTPWebRequests should be used instead of webclients
.A file grab method?
  if (File.Exists(Path))
        {
          //Email the file to user 
          //Or something along those lines
        } 


-Skype chat listener
.Needs to be cleaned up alot
.All commands need to be added and to pass proper parameters to server script
.Needs some basic user tools such as a resolve command that resolves a domain to ip and outputs in chat



....And more to come, now to sleep.
